A good example of this would be www.kalosawear.com which is a website that was made for women clothing in the Philippines, primarily silk and plus sized clothing. I designed everything including their logo as well as suggestions they could implement for their social media pages. Images also show the mobile site which was a priority for the client."

I had worked on implementing the download function for the apps that were hosted on Firebase as well as implementing a cache where commands sent by an API would be stored in the application until a user refreshed their application. This helped save costs on our Firebase membership as we were only using minimal commands instead of sending one every time a user needed to update."
